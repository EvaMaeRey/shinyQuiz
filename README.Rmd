# Creating shiny widgets for quizes

Works for shiny events apps (see shinyEvents package). A quiz is currently described in yaml format and then parsed into R.
```{r include=FALSE}
library(shinyQuiz)
# A simple multiple choice quiz
yaml = '
question: What is 20*20?
mc:
  - 100
  - 200
  - 400*
  - 500
'

qu = shinyQuiz(id="myquiz", yaml=yaml, quiz.handler=function(qu,solved,...) {
  cat("\nQuiz solved = ", solved)
})

```


```{r eval=FALSE}
library(shinyQuiz)
# A simple multiple choice quiz
yaml = '
question: What is 20*20?
mc:
  - 100
  - 200
  - 400*
  - 500
'

# A shiny app with events handling from shinyEvents
app = eventsApp()

qu = shinyQuiz(id="myquiz", yaml=yaml, quiz.handler=function(qu,solved,...) {
  cat("\nQuiz solved = ", solved)
})
app$ui = qu$ui
runEventsApp(app, launch.browser=rstudio::viewer)

```

The output looks as follows:
```{r results="asis",echo=FALSE}
p(qu$ui)
```


### Showing a quiz solution as HTML

```{r results='asis'}
ui = quiz.ui(qu, solution=TRUE)
p(ui)
```
